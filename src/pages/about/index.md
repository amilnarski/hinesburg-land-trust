Hinesburg Land Trust is a non-profit, all volunteer community organization, founded by local citizens interested in land planning and conservation issues.  HLT has helped conserve more than 2,000 acres of agricultural, natural and heritage land in Hinesburg.

All the land conserved by HLT is accessible to the public, and it features many walking and skiing trails. These beautiful, preserved areas are managed not only for traditional uses of hunting and fishing but have also provided the setting for bird, wildflower and tree-identification walks hosted by the HLT.
