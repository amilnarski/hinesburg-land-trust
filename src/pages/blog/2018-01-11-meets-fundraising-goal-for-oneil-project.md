Happy New to all, and a happy start to the new year it is for the Hinesburg Land Trust! Thanks to the generosity of HLT supporters, we successfully met our 2017 fundraising goal of $10,000 to conserve the O’Neil Farm in Hinesburg. Joe and Emily Donegan will take ownership of the farm in the first part of 2018. This conservation project permanently protects 259 acres of agricultural land and 44 acres of LaPlatte River corridor.

Thank you to all whose support made this possible!
