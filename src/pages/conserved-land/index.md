# Hinesburg Land Trust Projects
____

## O'Neil Farm
Throughout 2017 Hinesburg Land Trust (HLT) and Vermont Land Trust (VLT) worked with the O’Neil and Donegan families to conserve 259 acres of the former O’Neil farm. This project protects 259 acres of agricultural land and 44 acres of LaPlatte River corridor. Joe and Emily Donegan will take ownership of the farm in the first part of 2018.
Once conserved, 135 acres comprising the prime and statewide agricultural soils will remain in crops. The remaining acreage will be protected in a river corridor easement and riparian buffer zones that will serve to ameliorate flooding, protect downstream water quality, and enhance wildlife habitat. Features of ecological significance include shrub wetlands, red maple-green ash swamp, silver maple-sensitive fern floodplain forest, and a large area of maple-ash-hickory-oak forest.

## The Gillespie and Copp-Welch I and II properties
The Gillespie property is 37 acres of peaceful, wooded land, with hiking and skiing trails and also a tucked-away pond loaded with bullfrogs in the summer. Together with the adjoining state-owned Copp-Welch I and II properties there are over 150 acres, with trails through mixed hardwood forests, open meadows and spectacular rocky cliffs. These properties were acquired by the HLT with the assistance of local residents and partner conservation groups. These trails and the wonderful walking along Gilman Road, Lewis Creek Road and Turkey Lane offer recreational opportunities year-round.

## The LaPlatte Headwaters Conservation Project on Bissonette Farm
A [cooperative project between HLT and the Trust for Public Land](https://www.tpl.org/media-room/bissonette-farm-protected-vt#sm.0001lvjjdjpgbeh7t211ws6kgujs8), the LaPlatte Headwaters Project on the Bissonette Farm has conserved over 600 acres and resulted in the creation of the 301 acre LaPlatte Headwaters Town Forest. Please visit the [LaPlatte Headwaters Town Forest page](http://www.hinesburg.org/lhtf/) for more information (including trail maps). Conserved in 2007.

## The Isham Farm Project
Keeping agriculture as a part of our heritage is crucial, and recent efforts ensure that farming will continue to be a part of the landscape and economy of Hinesburg. In 2003, the HLT working with the Vermont Land Trust, facilitated the preservation of prime agricultural land in southern Hinesburg that allowed a young farm family to continue to operate the 100 year-old farm. Mountain’s Edge Farm, owned by Sean and Jennifer Lang, is now run with the help of former farm owners, Jean and Rod Isham.

## The Lincoln Hill Project
In 2001, the Hinesburg Land Trust acquired 144 acres on Lincoln Hill adjacent to the state-owned 1,150 acres of the Fred Johnson Wildlife Management Area. With the 850 acres of the Hinesburg Town Forest nearby, HLT sought to protect the wildlife corridor between these publicly held parcels and insure that habitat is not further fragmented by development. A VAST trail on this property also ensures that this network of snowmobile trails can continue to function. The parcel has now been turned over to the VTDFW.
